## Introduction

This repo contains a collection of examples that are used in the [`Webpack Guides`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).

## Using the examples

The easiest way to follow along with the guides is to clone this repo:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:TheDutchCoder/webpack-guides-code-examples.git
cd webpack-guides-code-examples
```

Then whenever you want to start a specific guide, navigate to the corresponding directory and run an `npm instal`. For example if you wanted to follow along with the [`Asset Management`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/) guide, you would do:

``` bash
cd asset-management
npm install
```
